        <div class="subheading mb-5"> Laboratory - Research Assistant</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Collaboration<br><br>
Working in a research lab, I was able to develop leadership strategies, as I worked with colleagues with different strengths and weaknesses regarding the latter as well as working under a program instructor, who helped dictate the pace of the experiments and the overall focus of our papers. Beinig able to adapt to situations necessary of constant collaboration has formulated myself into a person whose amicable yet resilient with my work and it rubs off on whoever I am to be working with. This has genuinely cultivated a love for my work and it will be an invaluable skill for any team to possibly have. Another one of my strengths is my ability to use my collaborative skils to deescalate any tense situations that may turn hostile. I am a level-headed and rational person, taking into account multiple different persepctives on a scenario, allowing for an unbiased, yet fair judgement of how things pan out. It is inevitable for roadblocks to occur within teams and it could lead to unwanted hostility. With my skills, I will be able to help mediate the latter and make sure everything runs smoothly. Whether it be a smaller group or a mini company, I will be sure to use my skills to make accurate and fair assessments and to help promote a healthy working environment for everyone, making sure things work the way they are supposed to. 
        
        <br><br>Critical Thinking<br><br>
Whilst working in the lab, I navigated through many interesting challenges that required its own unique way to solve it, whether it be administering a new method of testing or graphing data to be presented in front of a board of professionals within the field. I can affirm that the skills that I've learned can be applicable to almost all aspects of life and it will enrich my performance as a whole overall. I personally believe that critical thinking is an invaluable skill to have due to the fact that it shows a person's adaptability to high stress, unpredictable environments. In this day and age, the world is constantly evolving and nothing ever stays stagnant for long. Being able to improvse and think on the go is a skill that will be necessary for any sort of project, and I will continue to demonstrate again and again why I am suited for whatever task is thrown my way. 
        
        <br><br>Data Analysis<br><br> 
The research lab where I work at has a plethora of information needed to be organized into tangible bits and pieces to align with different hypotheseses. One of my main tasks there were to help conduct the collection of data through a variety of methods, such as physical labor as well as premade data programs to accurately analyze each and every action of the test subjects. The culmination of these methods has allowed me to become well-versed with many different types of data collection as well as the data analysis of all these pieces of information. How I view it, is like a little puzzle and each piece of data gets closer to uncovering mysteries unbeknowst to us and can help fuel further research as well.
